I'm a M.Sc. Biostatistics student from the Dalla Lana School of Public Health at the University of Toronto. My research interests are statistical genetics, Bayesian methods, causal inference, and neurotechnology. I also enjoy architecture photography, dancing, and hiking. Feel free to connect with me!
